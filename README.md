# PrepWise 🎓

A revolutionary platform to simplify exam preparation, resume building, and interview practice using AI-driven technologies.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Preparing for competitive exams, building professional resumes, practicing topic-specific MCQs, and preparing for interviews often lack personalization and efficiency. Current resources do not offer tailored solutions that adapt to individual timelines, learning paces, and goals. Additionally, the absence of interactive tools for interview preparation limits candidates' confidence and readiness.
